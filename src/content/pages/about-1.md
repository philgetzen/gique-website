# About Gique

### Vision

To create a world that champions both the arts and sciences as creative outlets for developing well-rounded, passionate problem-solvers.

### Mission

Gique is an MIT-based nonprofit 501(c)(3) which exists to engage students in creative, hands-on curricula, experiments and activities that develop their passion and potential to succeed in science, technology, engineering, art + design, and math ([STEAM](http://stemtosteam.org/)).

We believe all students deserve access to enriching opportunities and experiences needed to be successful in life, especially in underserved urban areas. We are committed to building the type of local and global learning communities that cultivate STEAM-powered innovators.   

We promise to elevate awareness of the importance of STEAM in public and charter education systems with all of our educational resources. We aim to uplift our students in ways that are culturally responsive, adapt to their unique needs, and are meaningful to their communities and everyday lives.

By providing free, hands-on educational programs and mentorship to youth from diverse circumstances, talented young people in Boston learn the skills necessary to become culture creators, rather than just consumers.

## Gique is the only nonprofit that supports _diverse learning styles_ by translating technical concepts through creative expressions that empower students to understand, enjoy and excel in STEAM education.
