### Fall 2015

# **Hands-On STEAM Program**

## **at Boys & Girls Clubs of Dorchester**

Gique's Hands-On STEAM Program at the [Boys & Girls Clubs of Dorchester](http://bgcdorchester.org/) is a weekly after-school program which provides students with the opportunity to explore their personal interests in science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math. Students receive mentorship from innovators from around the world and participate in hands-on workshops and field trips. By the end of the semester, students gain a better understanding of how they can take an idea from concept to reality through innovation with art + design, science, and technology.
