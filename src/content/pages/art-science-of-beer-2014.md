Thanks to all the guests who attended our Art + Science of Beer: Educational Tasting at Harpoon Brewery Boston. We hope you had as much fun as we did!

We enjoyed a range of freshly-brewed local craft beer samples while learning about how it's made from beer artists & scientists. We also invited our guests to check out our home brewing & craft beer art exhibits throughout the event.

We want to thank Harpoon Brewery's staff for giving our guests a tap talk and an up-close and personal view of their brew deck! Be sure to visit our sponsor, the [Modern Homebrew Emporium](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Modern-Homebrew-Emporium/260060401943) in Cambridge, MA. for all your home brewing needs!
