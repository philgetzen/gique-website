# Will Meyers

## Brewmaster at Cambridge Brewing Company

Born and raised in Philadelphia, Will Meyers studied music theory and composition and voice performance before moving to Boston and catching the craft beer bug. Will homebrewed his first beer in 1990 and has subsequently enjoyed a twenty-four-year-long career at Cambridge Brewing Company. In addition to his authentic interpretations of traditional beer styles, he crafts unique, adventuresome beers - some referencing ancient brews of the world and others breaking new ground in the art of brewing. His focus on experimentation and the development beginning in 1998 of CBC’s infamous Barrel Cellar has placed him at the forefront of America’s innovative artisanal brewers. Will steadfastly refuses to have to choose one single favorite beer.
