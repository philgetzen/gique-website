# STEAM Resources

This page was intended to connect students of all ages, parents, and teachers to just a few of the many [**STEAM**](http://stemtosteam.org) resources, programs, and other learning opportunities provided both in-person and online. Gique believes that STEAM learning shouldn't end when students leave their classrooms or our [**programs and workshops**](http://www.gique.me/event-calendar/). Check out the resources below to stay inspired in STEAM!

### Interested in Web Design or Learning How To Code? Don't Know Where To Begin?

Check out [**this awesome introductory guide about learning computer science**](https://www.vodien.com/blog/education/learning-computer-language-html-resource.php), shared with us by Gique Sarah from San Diego, CA, who is learning to code herself! This guide provides great information for both parents and students who are curious about advancing their computing skills through hands-on, self-led learning!

Also check out these awesome resources on [**color theory**](https://www.clevelandhomeshd.com/home-design-color-theory.php) and a beginner's guide to [**programming languages**](http://ithare.com/a-beginners-guide-to-programming-languages/), shared with us by Gique Tom Coner and his web design students from his local library!
