We'd like to thank the **MIT Office of Engineering Outreach Programs (OEOP)** for inviting our Founder, Danielle Olson, to speak to its students and their families at the **2014 STEM Mentoring Family Orientation.**

Danielle participated in the OEOP's Minority Introduction to Engineering & Science (MITES) program as a high schooler in 2009, which inspired her to pursue an engineering degree in college.

The mission of the OEOP is to diversify the science and engineering community by serving students from underrepresented and underserved backgrounds and empowering these students to develop the skills and confidence needed to pursue careers in technical fields.

If you are interested in inviting a **gique** to speak at your event, please [contact us](mailto:contact@gique.me)!
