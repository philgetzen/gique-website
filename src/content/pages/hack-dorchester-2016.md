## **PROGRAM INFO**

In Spring 2016, Gique after-school program students participated in their first-ever #HackDorchester Challenge at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Dorchester. Each team was matched with a **local mentor** and provided with a budget to design and prototype a project idea which addressed a problem in their community in one of the following categories: ****Housing & Employment, Climate Change, Education, Citizenship, and Public Health.**** 

The challenge culminated in **final pitch presentations on** **Tuesday April 26th from 7:00-8:00 PM** at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Dorchester McLaughlin Building (4th floor). This event will be free & open to the public. Food & refreshments will be served.
