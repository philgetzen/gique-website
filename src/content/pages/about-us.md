# **About Gique**  
 

## Vision

To create a world that champions both the arts and sciences as creative outlets for developing well-rounded, passionate problem-solvers.

## Mission

Gique is an MIT-based nonprofit 501(c)(3) which exists to engage students in creative, hands-on curricula, experiments and activities that develop their passion and potential to succeed in science, technology, engineering, art + design, and math ([STEAM](http://stemtosteam.org/)).

We believe all students deserve access to enriching opportunities and experiences needed to be successful in life, especially in underserved urban areas. We are committed to building the type of local and global learning communities that cultivate STEAM-powered innovators.   

We promise to elevate awareness of the importance of STEAM in public and charter education systems with all of our educational resources. We aim to uplift our students in ways that are culturally responsive, adapt to their unique needs, and are meaningful to their communities and everyday lives.

By providing free, hands-on educational programs and mentorship to youth from diverse circumstances, talented young people in Boston learn the skills necessary to become culture creators, rather than just consumers.

# Gique is the only nonprofit that supports _diverse learning styles_ by translating technical concepts through creative expressions that empower students to understand, enjoy and excel in STEAM education.

# College Intern Program

Gique is fortunate to be located in Cambridge, MA, a hub of prestigious higher education, with a diverse pool of talented students who are passionate about both giving back and gaining real-world experience. We have had gratifying experiences in the past working with and mentoring volunteer college student interns.

We are always seeking talented, hard-working candidates enrolled in local colleges and universities to join our Cambridge, MA, operations team as a volunteer intern. We are committed to fostering a program that is beneficial for both Gique and its interns: **_identifying opportunities within our organization for you to develop your unique skills and interests while working side-by-side with experienced mentors._**

Given the diverse backgrounds and professions of our team, we are very flexible and accommodating to the busy schedules of college students and have an existing infrastructure for working productively both in-person (at our HQ in the heart of Porter Square) and remotely (via Slack, Google Hangouts, and conference calls). There's usually delicious snacks and food involved at all of our meetings! Finally, we are also happy to provide confirmation of your service as part of any community service program requirements. We have selectively provided letters of recommendation and employment referrals for past interns who contributed exceptional work to our organization.

Gique is also a proud nonprofit partner of [Northeastern University's Civic Engagement Program (CEP)](https://www.northeastern.edu/communityservice/programs/long-term-programs/civic-engagement-program/), which aims to redefine scholarship by ensuring that students receiving Northeastern’s most prestigious scholarships not only excel academically, but have the opportunity to grow as civic-minded individuals who give back through service to our local and global communities.
