[Gique](http://www.gique.me/)'s Art & Science of Beer Event is an [annual event hosted during the Cambridge Science Festival](http://www.cambridgesciencefestival.org/event/art-science-of-beer-with-gique-and-guinness/) which allows 21+ folks to celebrate their love for the art and science of beer!

This event included a private tasting of a range of Guinness beer samples and learning about how Guinness beer has been made over the years, around the world from Guinness Brewery Ambassador and Certified Cicerone, Michael Reardon. After our tasting, guests could hang out with other giques, learn about the art and design of craft beer bottles and cans, and enjoy delicious food and drinks.

**Thank you to K2 Cafe, the Cambridge Science Festival, and Guinness for sponsoring this event!**
