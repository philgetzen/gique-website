## Gique's Science Can Dance program provides youth with a way to explore science, technology, and engineering through exercise, creative movement, & dance choreography.

Each workshop is led by local dancers who are also scientists and engineers, which provides a unique mentorship opportunity for students interested in both the arts + STEM. Given our program's innovative approach to STEAM education, [Science Can DANCE! has been featured on PBS NOVA's School of the Future Series](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/dancing-to-learn.html) (see video below).
