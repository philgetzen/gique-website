# Fab Festival  |  FAB11

**We had a great time at [Fab Fest 2015](http://www.fab11.org/fab-festival/) teaching about how 3D Printers work through dance choreography and body movement!** This was a one of a kind celebration of the global fab lab community! Eleven years and over 500 fab labs later, the [International Fab Lab Network](http://empty-ice-3260.herokuapp.com/refinery/) returned to Boston — its birthplace. Fab labs are publicly-accessible workshops with digital fabrication tools like 3D printers and laser cutters that allow you to “make almost anything.” The weekend Fab Fest connected local and international innovators to provide hands-on educational and entertaining experiences for everyone.
